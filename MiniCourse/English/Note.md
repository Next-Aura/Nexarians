# Notes for the Mini Course on AI and Machine Learning

Hello friends who are taking this MiniCourse! Before we continue, I want to give you a few notes about this course, what you might need to pay attention to, and a little bit about myself. This course is designed for those of you who are just starting out, so if anything feels off, please let me know—I'm still learning too!

## Potential Mistakes in This Mini Course

This course is designed to be simple and easy to understand, but there are a few things you might want to know to avoid confusion:

1. **Overly Simple Data**
- In examples like guessing the price of a house, the data is super basic (just the size and price). The real world is usually more complicated—there are many other features like location, number of bedrooms, or the condition of the house. So, the models in this course are just for basic learning, okay?
- **Why?** To make it easier for beginners to understand. If you want to try something more complex, try adding other features to your data while practicing.

2. **Minimalist Code**
- The code in Lesson 3 uses super simple linear regression. In real-world practice, you might need to check the model's accuracy (for example, using metrics like *mean squared error*) or try other algorithms. This course is just to give you an initial overview.
- **Suggestion:** Once you're comfortable with the code here, try googling how to evaluate the model or using another library like TensorFlow or asking your favorite chatbot.

3. **Set Up the Coding Environment**
- When trying to set up Python or Jupyter Notebook, you might encounter errors, such as incompatible library versions or an unsupported laptop. This is perfectly normal, especially for beginners.
- **Solution:** Check the official Python or scikit-learn documentation, or try using an online platform like Google Colab—it's free and easy!

4. **Language That Might Be Too Casual**
- I intentionally made this course's language casual to make it fun, but if there are any terms that are unclear or feel too slang, please let me know via DM or the comments section! I want everyone to feel comfortable learning.

### About Me, the Creator of This Course

I'm just a young person who's really excited about AI and machine learning! Creating this mini-course is my way of sharing my knowledge, while making this seemingly complicated topic fun and easy to understand. I'm not a professor or a senior AI expert—just a regular person who enjoys exploring, learning from AI, videos, and online communities, and I want to invite you to dive into the world of AI.

Why did I create this? Because I believe AI is like a 'magic' tool that can help solve many problems, and also to build the Nexarians community, which is intended to be an open learning space where everyone—including young people like us—can learn and create cool things using AI. So, if this course has piqued your curiosity to explore further, my mission has been successful!

### Closing Message

If you encounter any errors, are confused by the explanations, or have any suggestions, please let me know (via comments or DM, hehe). Learning AI is like playing a game: sometimes you fall, sometimes you get confused, but as long as you keep trying, you'll eventually level up! Thank you for taking this course, and I hope you become addicted to exploring the world of AI!

Keep up the good work,
